Here are for Sn-132 the parameters for the different runs for Z and A/Q values.

They are saved for the variable appearing in the name of the file.
The files conists of three rows:

 run-number, mean-value of the peak and the spread (1sigma)

Note run 0024 is still missing, also it appears!

Zero is before the target, everything else behind. The best values (smallest spread)
are ZET[3] and AOQ[2] also the other values will help to decrease the background.
