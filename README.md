# riken
this is a project to analyze the PDR in Sn-128 & Sn-132. The exp has been performed at RIKEN and the analysis is based on anaroot and shogun-sim.

MakeTree:
	- There are a bunch of macros to generate root-files out of the ridf-files
	- the latest is MakeTree*

macros:
	- several macros to analyze the root-files for Sn-128 and Sn-132
	- There exists scripts to get the resolution in A/Q and Z and different stuff, also to optimize the PID
	- analys* are macros to analyze the decay after criteria of the PID

cutParamters:
	- here are the files which contains the mean and sigma of the fits used to identify the particles and gammas
